## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/georgeboca1/admin-panel.git
cd admin-panel
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
- Linux/macOS:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
python main.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000` with auto-reload enabled for development.

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access:
- Interactive API documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
